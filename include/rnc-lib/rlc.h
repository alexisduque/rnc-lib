        /** \brief Stores a set of blocks

            A \c BlockList object provides a "view" to coded
            data. Multiple BlockLists can view the same data; thus,
            multiple subsets can be used for operations at the same time
            without copying the data.

            A BlockList can store an arbitrary number of \c Block objects.
            It uses an exponentially sized array list to do that: whenever
            the capacity of the list is exceeded, the array is reallocated
            with its size doubled. This avoids costly reallocations and
            slow list traversals at the possible cost of heap capacity.

            \remark Because of the exponential resizing, it is important
            to specify a reasonable starting capacity.

            \remark In most cases, the number of blocks in a file (\c
            BlockList::coeff_count) may be a perfect choice for starting
            capacity.

            \remark The array list contains only pointers, so the actual
            heap overhead is pretty low.

                          object, destroy the underlying data too

                   \remarks Choose the initial capacity wisely to avoid
                            high heap overhead and costly reallocations.

                   \remarks Setting <tt>cleanup = true</tt> will free the
                            heap area containing the underlying data. Use
                            this when the \c BlockList object's life
                            cycle coincides with that of the data.

                   \remarks It may be a good idea to have such a \c
                            BlockList objectâ€”one whose lifecycle coincides
                            with that of the blocks comprising a coded
                            file. That is, the \c BlockList can be used as
                            a memory manager for blocks.

                   \remarks Among \c BlockList objects viewing the same
                            data, at most a single one can have \c cleanup
                            set to \c true . Having more than one freeing
                            the same heap space will cause a segmentation
                            fault.
